For the next version

@update readme roadmap section

- [ ] Macros: make changes with regex on type: strings
- [ ] Press enter to go to the next instance? Arrow keys?
- [ ] Create server failure modal
- [ ] Remove modals from redux and create a switch that accesses each modal with
  its own data
- [ ] New Table wizard: Ask for number of instances and the initial schema
- [ ] Create async thunk for rendering data cells faster on chromium-based. firefox is fine, weirdly enough
- [ ] Create tests — YAY!
- [ ] Clear all cells of instance/property
- [ ] Reverse order of instances
- [ ] Add custom scrollbars
- [ ] Make context menu render upwards if too low
- [ ] Allow for instance naming, because js orders numbers properly, so array feel should stay the same
- [ ] Before creating a new table, check if there is any non-saved tables. If there are, pop a modal to confirm operation.
- [ ] Cell being highlighted when selected and having its own context menu!
- [ ] Render arrays as html lists
- [ ] Select value of column \ field type: string, number, array, object
- [ ] Add a schema builder. Think a modal that allows you to chose a name and type for each property field **and** automatically generates all columns
- [ ] User-created tiny widgets with inputs. (Think back to resumes and creating formation card like college or course)
- [ ] Iterate feature: same as repeat, but: (both strings and other types)
  - [ ] accept the index to change the value repeated
  - [ ] adds a random number
  - [ ] picks randomly from a list of options
- [ ] Autosave to localstorage
- [ ] create wizard for adding instances
- [ ] Backend authentication and storage ???
  - [ ] Limit size of tables to a certain kb or mb limit
  - [ ] Limit number of tables on cloud to 5 ???
  - [ ] add Mongoose integration
  - [ ] Account management (password emails, updates, etc.)
- [ ] tooltip for help according to session — new users ALWAYS get the tooltips, but people already registered wouldn't get it anymore.
- [ ] Combine two columns in one. The cell of the second column gets rendered in a row below the cell of the first
- [ ] Use typescript. The interfaces thing seems pretty good.
- [ ] Add different exporting options
  - [ ] full file
  - [ ] only rows
  - [ ] html table
- [ ] Add undos and redos
- [ ] ANIMATIONS!
- [ ] Instead of a file, take the json list straight from client's clipboard. Or, at least, let them paste it in a box and use that box to create the table
- [ ] Abstract all box modals into a HOC then implement behavior common to all (essentially, to render through a portal, and have some niceties)
- [ ] Swap redux system for react-router system for rendering modals
- [ ] Move language from context store to redux store
- [ ] Change modals to use the `<dialog>` tag
- [ ] Change context menus to use `menu` tag
- [ ] Use different cursors, like "cell" or "resize" for proper stuff

Refactors:

- [x] Rename EVERY row to instance and EVERY heading to property. The current naming is conceptually coupled — what if I transpose the table?
- [x] Clean up cell actions with context menus and action bar buttons
- [x] Create separate component for index th's called IndexCell
- [x] Use redux for state management
- [ ] Refactor Context Menu
  - [ ] Change it to DropdownMenu that happens to be used as context menu
  - [ ] Make DropdownMenu take an array of props to make buttons based upon.
  - [ ] Make DropdownMenu use a portal
- [ ] Make edit buttons become disables if the type selected does not support said operation — or if nothing is selected at at all
- [ ] Make selected thing be highlighted

Types of field to add:

- [ ] string
- [ ] number
- [ ] array - each element gets rendered as <li>
- [ ] bool - rendered as checklist
- [ ] date - rendered as date picker
- [ ] dropdown / select - gets a pool of strings to be selected
- [ ] links - gets rendered as link
- [ ] random picker - the user gives a pool of values (values must have same type and be string, number or bool) and a random value is assigned at creation of row
- [ ] Checklist - array made up of preset values
